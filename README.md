Travelers Competition- 
Problem Statement - 
Quote conversion rate of Peace of Mind Insurance company is just over 11%. 
Personal automotive insurance Department of the company wants to build a model with the goal of understanding the pool of customers who are likely to convert over its competitors

The data provided to you consists of variables describing customers that asked for quotes. There are three datasets: at the policy, driver, and vehicle levels. Each row of the policy dataset corresponds to a single policy, which may be associated with multiple drivers and vehicles. Likewise, each row of the driver dataset represents a single driver, and each row of the vehicle dataset represents a single vehicle. It's easy to check that each driver and each vehicle are associated with just one policy. You may assume that all members on a policy live at the same address.

Your company was only able to convert a fraction of the policies found in this sample. The policy dataset also has a training and test split variable called split. Note that the conversion indicator (the response variable) is missing for policies in the test split. Your task is to build a model on the training data and apply your model to predict the conversion indicator for each policy in test data.

Goals in this competition are as follows:
Identify quoted policies that your company will convert (a.k.a. issue)
Understand key characteristics of policies your company tends to write, as well as those they tend not to write (e.g. understand quoted policies with both high and low conversion rates)
Provide a recommendation on how this information could be leveraged at Peace of Mind Insurance
